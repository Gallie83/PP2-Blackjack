                <p>In Blackjack, the dealer and player are both dealt 2 cards.
                    <br>
                    The object of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
                    <br>
                    Cards are worth their numerical value while picture cards are worth 10.
                    <br>
                    Aces are worth 11 unless 21 is exceeded, then they are worth 1.
                    If the player has 5 cards and still remains under 21, they win.
