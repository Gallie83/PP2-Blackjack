# **_BlackJack_**

BlackJack is a classic card game where the player and dealer both try to get as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. It is a well known game played in casinos worldwide.

# User Experience (UX)

## User Stories

* As a user I want to see clearly how the game is layed out.
* As a user I want to easily be able to see how the game is played.
* As a user I want to have all the game functions visible when the screen loads up.
* As a user I want to have access to the game on a variety of devices.
* As a user I want to have my progress through the game tracked.

## Design Choices

 * ### Typography
      The font I chose for the body was 'Special Elite', which I found on <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Fonts</a>.
      I chose this font as it gave a gritty, old western feel to the website which fit into the aesthetic I was going for.

      ![Body Font image](readme-images/body-font.png)

      For the heading of the website I went with the 'Great Vibes' font. The elegant look of this contrasted well with the more rugged look of 'Special Elite'.

      ![Heading Font image](readme-images/heading-font.png)

 * ### Colour Scheme
      The colour scheme eventually chosen is mostly black. I chose a dark background as the cards are then left to be the main focal point of the website. I also have the win/lose message in red to stand out from the black background, it also matches the red back of the cards.

# Features

The BlackJack website is designed to be simple and legible above all else.

## Existing Features  
  * ### How to Play

    * Located underneath the heading, there is a 'How to play button'.
    ![How to play image](readme-images/how-to-play.png)

    * When clicked, a paragraph explaining the rules appears, and dissapears on the second click.

  * ### Dealer Cards

      * Below the How to play button are the dealers cards. One card remains face down until the round is over. If the player wins via blackjack or the five card rule, or goes bust however, then the dealers card does not turn over.

  * ### Player Cards

      * Below the dealers cards are the players cards. Above the card images is a counter telling the player how much their hand is currently worth.

  * ### Game Buttons

      * The players card are followed by the game buttons- 'Hit', 'Stand' and 'New Deal' which functions are explained in the 'How to Play' section.
      Underneath the game buttons are the score counters for how many round you have won vs the dealer.
      ![Game Buttons image](readme-images/game-buttons.png)

  * ### Resonsiveness
      * The website is responsive accross all screen sizes. The cards and content scale down to allow it to retain its legibility on smaller screens. 


## Future Features 

* A betting system so that players would start with a certain amount of money and be able to bet as much as they want per hand.
* Players to be able to carry their score over after the browser window is closed.
* An online leaderboard so players could compare their scores to their friends.
