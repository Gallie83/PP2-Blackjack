# User Experience (UX)

## User Stories

* As a user I want to see clearly how the game is layed out.
* As a user I want to easily be able to see how the game is played.
* As a user I want to have all the game functions visible when the screen loads up.
* As a user I want to have access to the game on a variety of devices.
* As a user I want to have my progress through the game tracked.

## Design Choices

 * ### Typography
      The font I chose for the body was 'Special Elite', which I found on <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Fonts</a>.
      I chose this font as it gave a gritty, old western feel to the website which fit into the aesthetic I was going for.

      ![Body Font image](assets/readme/readme-images/body-font.png)

      For the heading of the website I went with the 'Great Vibes' font. The elegant look of this contrasted well with the more rugged look of 'Special Elite'.

      ![Heading Font image](assets/readme/readme-images/heading-font.png)

 * ### Colour Scheme
      The colour scheme eventually chosen is mostly black. I chose a dark background as the cards are then left to be the main focal point of the website. I also have the win/lose message in red to stand out from the black background, it also matches the red back of the cards.

# Features

The BlackJack website is designed to be simple and legible above all else.

## Existing Features

  * ### Home Image

      * Located on the home page beneath the navigation bar. It is a picture of the band playing live. Sitting on this image is cover text promoting the new album. The cover text acts as a link to the album page which has more information and on smaller screens the cover text disappears to avoid the page being over saturated.

    * This section has a background image of the band standing infront of the sunset. This imagery behind the information on the bands history adds a nice sentiment to the bands background.
    * Under the background section, is the mailing list, encouraging users to keep up to date with the bands releases.
