# User Experience (UX)

## User Stories

* As a user I want to see clearly how the game is layed out.
* As a user I want to easily be able to see how the game is played.
* As a user I want to have all the game functions visible when the screen loads up.
* As a user I want to have access to the game on a variety of devices.
* As a user I want to have my progress through the game tracked.

## Design Choices

 * ### Typography
      The font I chose for the body was 'Special Elite', which I found on <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Fonts</a>.

 * ### Colour Scheme
      The colour scheme eventually chosen is one based on black and orange. I started with a deep black navbar and footer. I then added the cover text with an orange border to make it stand out and pop on the home screen and eventually landed on a clean, white background color for the body.

# Features

The Afterlife site is set up to be clear and easy to navigate. It has many features that the user would probably be familiar with, such as a navigation bar or dropdown menu. The feel of the website is meant to be straight forward and easy to find what you are looking for. 

## Existing Features  
  * ### Navigation Menu

    * Located at the top of each page, it clearly shows how to access different parts of the website. On smaller devices, the links in the navbar, scale down to a dropdown menu to retain accessiblity but reduce the screen looking cluttered. The page the user is currently on remains highlighted.

  * ### Home Image

      * Located on the home page beneath the navigation bar. It is a picture of the band playing live. Sitting on this image is cover text promoting the new album. The cover text acts as a link to the album page which has more information and on smaller screens the cover text disappears to avoid the page being over saturated. 

![Home image](assets/readme-assets/main-home-img.png)

  * ### Our background
    * The Our background section lets the user know who Afterlife are and where they come from. 
    * This section has a background image of the band standing infront of the sunset. This imagery behind the information on the bands history adds a nice sentiment to the bands background.
    * Under the background section, is the mailing list, encouraging users to keep up to date with the bands releases.

* ### Footer
    
    * Contains social media links. To enhance the UX the links open in other tabs.
    * The social media presence will help the user keep up to date and informed about Afterlife.

* ### Album
    * The album page is there to showcase the upcoming and previous projects of the band. With the album art on the left , and the album description adjascent, it gives a glimpse into the inspiration and the artistic inception of each of the bands projects.

* ### Merch

    * This section shows where you can buy merchandise to support the band. With a brief description on what the merchandise website contains, it then has a button below directing you to the merchandise site. Similarly , the image next to the description also acts as a link to the site.
    * Below this, there is a description for the jewellery partner of the band, also accompanied with links and a picture.

* ### Contact 
    *The Contact page provides a chance for the user to connect with the band and ask any questions they have after navigating the information on the site. 

    *There are 3 input areas and a sumbit button on the contact form. After the form is submitted it takes the user to the submit page.

* ### Submit page 
    * This submit page reassures the user that their question has been received and will be replied to promptly. For this project it validates the form only.
    * The Navigation bar provides easy access back to the rest of the website.

## Future Features
